What's Here
===========

At present we are in a prototyping mode.  These prototypes exist in
`.../prototypes`.  As a recommended practice, developers are invited to
include individual prototypes in some scratch workspace denoted by the
developer's prefered UNIX handle.  For exammple: if my REX email address is
`jriehl@rexhomes.com`, then I would stash prototype and scratch work in
`.../prototypes/jriehl`.
